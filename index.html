I just told my senators to oppose Trump's pick for Supreme Court -- Neil Gorsuch.

Will you call your senators?  You can do so using this site -- it'll just take a minute or two.

Gorsuch is he is even more conservative than Antonin Scalia was.  Republicans are trying to ram through his confirmation -- and several Democrats are considering caving and joining them.

Gorsuch has a long history of siding with powerful interests over everyday Americans.  And as Trump launches rhetorical attacks on the judiciary, tries to accumulate ever more power for himself and big business interests, and seeks to undermine civil rights and social justice we simply cannot afford to let the court shift to the far right.

The Senate will be voting on Gorsuch soon -- please call your senators now and tell them to vote no.
